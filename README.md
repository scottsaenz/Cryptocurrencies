# Cryptocurrencies
<p>
This notebook performs principal component analysis on different crypto currencies.
This uses k-means clustering with visualizing the inertia while stepping through different values of k.
This allows us to determine the ideal value of k, enabling us to perform further analysis on the different groups of crypto currency.
